GlassFish Milestones
====================

This simple project scrapes the wiki pages and generates a .ics file containing entries for the builds and milestones for the 3.1.1 and the 3.2 release cycles.  To generate your own, you simply need to check out the project using git and run `mvn exec:java`.  This will generate a milestones.ics file in the directory which you can simple import into the calendar tool of your choice.  Alternately, you can use the autogenerated .ics file found [here](http://antwerkz.com/files/milestones.ics).  This file automatically updated every few hours and tracks the source changes as well so should always reflect the latest version of the .ics file and the latest data as defined on the wiki.

Reference Pages
---------------

For reference, this tool scrapes the following pages for its data:

* [GlassFish Server Open Source Edition - 3.x Schedule](http://wikis.sun.com/display/GlassFish/GlassFishV3Schedule)
* [GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 3.2 Build Schedule](http://wikis.sun.com/display/GlassFish/3.2BuildSchedule)
* [GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 3.1.1 Build Schedule](http://wikis.sun.com/display/GlassFish/3.1.1BuildSchedule)

The data is in the calendar is only as good as the wiki so if you notice any discrepancies, please ask about them on the [glassfish mailing lists](http://glassfish.java.net/public/mailing-lists.html).  Please note, though, that this calendar generation is an external, personal project of mine so no support will be provide for *this* code on the lists.  If you find issues with this project specifically please file an [issue](https://github.com/evanchooly/glassfish-milestones/issues) on github.
